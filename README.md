<img width="300px" align="left" src="./doc/main_logo.png" />

Welcome to **Passionfy**, a sleek and dynamic app designed to help you discover connections, explore shared interests, and spark meaningful relationships! 🌟 Built exclusively for **iOS 16** using the powerful **SwiftUI**, Passionfy offers a feature-rich experience with eye-catching design and smooth animations. 🎉

This app is powered by **SwiftUI**, Apple's declarative framework for building modern user interfaces, and follows **Clean Code** principles to ensure scalability, maintainability, and high performance. 

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the [AppStuff](https://www.youtube.com/@appstuff5778) YouTube channel for providing such valuable resources. I used one of the channel’s videos as a key learning tool and starting point for developing my SwiftUI app. The tutorial was incredibly helpful in understanding UI development, and it gave me a solid foundation to build upon. Since then, I’ve made significant modifications to the app with my own architecture approach and added new features. Your content has been a huge inspiration and has played a key role in my progress. Thanks again for all the help!
